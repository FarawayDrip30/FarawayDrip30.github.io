do not read this blog. it took a while to write and I don't like it anymore. please ignore.



# Farablog #1

Welcome to my blog (web log), a place where I just get to talk about stuff that I wanna - mainly media, I'm specifically interested in Videogames and Music (I'm not too interested in films or shows but if I watch something that's interesting enough I might write about it.) I make both of these things, to which I'm sure you're aware if you're already at my website, so I'll also be talking about stuff that I've made recently, and also about the designs of these things because I've tricked myself into thinking I'm competent enough about these things to talk about them.

I'm not gonna have a release schedule for this blog because sometimes I just might not have shit to talk about, which I'm 100% sure will mean that I will likely only release this one and then forget about it for an indeterminate amount of time before someone may or may not remind me in which case I will probably not bother to make one because it's too much effort.

## Music

### Parklife (Live at Wembley) - Blur

I am a big britpop fan, and out of all four of the britpop bands worth listening to blur is my favourite - they're one of the few bands of which I have listened to every album of. Naturally any release from them is the music fan equivalent of getting your face smashed in with a oil-covered brick for an oil or brick fan, and doubly so if the person is a fan of both, I'm looking forward to the "To the End" documentary that's coming out, because the latest blur documentary that I've seen was "No Distance Left to Run", which was recorded in 2012 and so is missing out on their latest two albums, ignoring "New World Towers" because I didn't see it and they also used the title from the worst song on the album so it doesn't earn my respect.  

Despite this, live albums are something I've only had the barest of interests in recently, and so the unveil of a single from (and later a full album of) a live performance doesn't completely do it for me, HOWEVER! Recently in a desire to only listen to the songs I already listen to on repeat but give the impression that I branch out and have varied musical tastes, I have listened to a good few live versions of songs now, and I think they can be interesting, aside from just breaking up the norm on how I listen to the same tracks.   

For one, they can be vastly different and convey different tones to the album releases, such as Gary Numan's recent live versions of his songs (Listen to a live version of "Cars" or "Are 'Friends' Electric?"), which are played in a darker, more sinister style to better resemble his most recent original tracks, or Oasis' version of I am the Walrus (although there isn't an actual studio recording of the version so maybe doesn't count). They can also be a more impressive version of said tracks as the artists have since gained experience, no examples I know of yet but I'm sure there are, perhaps relating to a third possibility of the live versions being better than the originals, such as The Streets of Philadelphia (Bruce Springsteen) and another song I forgot and probably will not put back here once I have remembered it. I think the Ghost of Tom Joad also by Springsteen. But something that everyone can usually count on is that the live versions are probably going to be fater than the original, which is the case with this version!!!

When listening I was wondering if speeding up a usually mid-tempo song this much is a good idea, a thought that was incredibly and luckily ejected at high force out of my brain and hitting the nearest pedestrian, leaving them in an untimely heap that nobody is around to help them out with. It's important to remember, in my opinion, that many songs played at live gigs (excluding maybe local gigs) are cultural touchstones to at least the people there, and that is especially true with Parklife, and so it doesn't really matter what speed those songs are played at as most people know all the instrumentation and words anyway - you could play the entirety of 'Blueberry Hill' in the span of 30 seconds and people would (debatably) thouroughly enjoy it, something that my dearest father (debatably) proved in his old punk band.  

At the end of these live performances there are sometimes left-on discussions between the band to themselves or the audience. In this one they're talking about how Damon and Graham knew each other at 12/13 years old at school and are now playing in a big stadium, cutting of the next song, Far Out, from starting in the process. I think it's important to have these little human touches now in the wake of AI (although I know the issue of AI in music is it being used instead of paying musicians as a job instead of having Gorillaz-esque fake band or whatever but whatever, it still adds a human touch). It reminds me of "Sometimes We're Very Sad" by Supergrass, a B-side on "Richard III", where it's just showing the band uncontrollably laughing at them making the mouth-made percussion sounds of the other B-side (and one of the best songs on "In it for the Money") "Sometimes We Make You Sad". I just like these little things, and I hope I find more of them so I can further forward my parasocial relationships with these bands.  

### Head Music - Suede

As previously stated, big britpop fan here, and so I also like Suede!!!!! Not as much as blur but you get me. My first time listening to them was when I found a CD of "Coming Up" in a charity shop and bought it because A. I knew it was britpop and B. the cover was cool. Every song on that album could've been a single, something I'm sure the band knew considering they got 5 of them outta it. After I liked this album, I tried to listen to "Suede", their debut album and the one with two gay men kissing, and I did like it (the album, not the two gay men kissing) (in a heterosexual way not a homophobic way) but I noticed that I didn't enjoy every single song on the album like with coming up.  

I decided that the reason for this may be that I prefer the more 'upbeat/poppy' records by the band, and so I decided to listen to head music as it looked like it would be the same kinda thing as Coming Up - After listening I came to the same conclusion as on "Suede", that although I liked many songs on the album, I felt like there were a good few unmemorable or boring ones.

I have a thing where if I like one song for an album, I'll feel like I need to like all the other songs in it. I don't know why, but I do. Obviously this isn't great and I have luckily realised this, but I do still think it's important to think about these lesser songs. Just because their hooks aren't as catchy or they aren't as "good", should everyone just forget about these songs? I think, in a way, kinda? If you don't like a song you definitely shouldn't force yourself to listen to it, and obviously the less hooky or good a song is, the less people are gonna listen to it. But as is the point of the Bomb the Music Industry! song, 'It Ceases to Be "Whining" If You're Still "Shitting" Blood', most of the time music isn't written to blow up or get listened to, but for the artist. (Although after reading up on Suede, perhaps this ain't true in this case.) I made a dumbfuck song called "Peepeepoopoo" where I made a soundfont out of mr blowing a raspberry for a dumbfuck friday night funkin' mod I never made, do you think I'm sad it never topped the charts? If there is an audience for these songs, they'll like them when they here them, and the artist can enjoy what they've made either way.

Anyway, that being over and done with, my favourite songs from this album are "Savoir Faire", "She's in Fashion", "Head Music", which has the wildest chorus in a mainstream song that I've heard by the way, "Elephant Man", and "Hi-Fi".

### My Games

### Battlements

Still working on it! I've recently realised that I'm a guy that's put a lot of things off for when I have "more time", and then never realise when I do actually have "more time", or utilise the time I usually have which is probably enough anyway. I've been doing a lot of stuff to help redirect all of this time to do the things I put off for later, which has mainly been just deleting social media offa my phone, and also installing a [cool browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/close-twitter/obamldjmejjnbioppjagfhbidldhjnkf) that redirects me to a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE8CgwBYvEo&ab_channel=LukeCorreia) of a very trustworthy-looking cat that tells me to get off twitter when I go onto twitter. This has definitely helped me with preventing myself from continually continuing slop and I haven't been getting any craving to disable the extension or reinstall the apps because, as my years of research have led me to discover, social media is NOT crack cocaine! I've also occasionally been going onto [Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org/) and just checking out other people's sites, both for ideas for mine (such as this blog, actually!) and also there's just something very human about it all. People on these kinds of websites show a lot of their thoughts and personalities, and it's great to just check out the [weird stuff](https://felixfever.nekoweb.org/) sometimes. You don't get the whole infinite dopamine thing from it as well, so it never actually distracts me from what I wanna do. I've also made [my own funky little website](https://farawaydrip30.nekoweb.org/) on there that I plan to update more in the future, so as they say in the industry be sure to smazz your way down the poundtown, baby.

### Flines

[flines](https://raflines.github.io/) asked me if I could talk about him in the blog so here you go. I FUCKING HATE HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HOPE HE DIES!!!!!!!!!! STUPID LITTLE OTTER HEDGEHOG MAN that **CLEARLY** has NO idea what he's DOING, EVER and also holds HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE opinions on WOMEN, MINORITES, and ROE V. WADE.  

Despite all this, damn does he make really cool-looking games. Same goes for the other guys in the group, [reman](https://ratmanteam.github.io/index.html) and [Craity](https://craity.carrd.co/). When they make a game, they MAKE a GAME. Specifically the amount of polish they have on everything, which is something my games desperately need. I think the main reason that it's so off the charts is because they are all or used to be art guys - they know what's gotta look good, which, although gameplay should be the focus, makes games seem to be a whole lot better. I think my love for punk and general rough-around-the-edges art is good, but when I make things that I don't really want to be in that style and instead do wanna make polished, such as [Flashbang Ninja](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/887367), it's a lot easier for me to overlook things. I do, however, think I'm getting gradually better at that kind of thing, and I'm proud of the polish in my more recent games, even Super Raptor Producer, which I only made in one day. I think a reason for this is actually paying attention to sound design more, which a load of gamedevs on the internet seem to say is a big [factor](https://www.boots.com/toiletries/suncare/factor-50-sun-cream).

### Not My Games

### Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc - Ubisoft

I have a thing with Rayman games where I play the first few levels and then completely forget about and don't touch again, specifically Rayman Origins for the Wii, which I later just sold, and my two copies of Rayman 2. They're just really good at selling it to me, I guess. This was almost the case with Rayman 3 too, but recently I was in a PS2 game mood, and since my copy of [Smarties Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarties:_Meltdown) doesn't work this was the next best thing.  

Firstly, I think I wanna talk about what this game's main focus is, which I believe is the combat. I believe this because the platforming is both generic and bad - In your base moveset you can only run, jump and glide, which I'm sure 

### Animal Well - Shared Memory

Blah blah blah.
