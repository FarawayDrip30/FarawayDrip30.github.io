                    <p>Why? Eh. I have two personal sites (technically three with neocities, but that's been long forgotten) and I don't really want this one to be a catalogue of cats, but something more personal. </p>
                    <p>The only reason I made it a cat catalogue thing in the first place was because this site is themed around cats. All geocities successors are cats for some reason anyway so that doesn't matter. I don't even specifically like cats - not dislike them, just no particular special enjoyment. I'm also thinking about the cats on this site like "Cool For Cats", the Squeeze album/song, and not anime catgirls or whatever. Please keep this difference in mind.</p>
                    <p>I'm happy with the art and stuff I just don't want that to be what the page is!</p>
                    <p>Having it be also a blog page or whatever is also something I'm not sure about cos I'm making a blog for my main page, or maybe not I don't know. I'll figure it out!</p>

                <p>If anyone can tell me how you get that cat running around the screen on my site automatically, please email me at "FarawayDrip30yt@gmail.com" because I just kind of want it and can't find how to or can be bothered to code it to get it to do that.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I'm a guy that likes to make stuff, my main thing is videogames (which you can find <a href="https://farawaydrip30.itch.io/">here</a>), but I've been really enjoying making music recently too!! I've mainly done music for my / occasionally other people's videogames in the past in digital workstations, but as most of my games were made in game jams they unfortunately took the back seat. However, I was in a 'band' (two people) a bit ago, and although it didn't last too long it made me realise that I actually really like making music with physical instruments, and I've been trying to do that by myself. It's harder to do it by yourself than in a 'band' because I can't play the drums and guitar at the same time, but I'm getting better, I think. I've also installed FL Studio (previously I've been using reaper for the digital stuff) and I think it has helped with my music because I'm making a song for someone else's game about eating mobile phones and I think it's actually really good. It's not finished yet so I don't wanna share it unfortunately. Anyway, I wanna make an album with the whole physical instruments thing, but I don't like my voice and recording instruments is hard especially for drums. I'll cross the hurdles somehow. I also like to draw - I wanna make a comic sometime in the future (I already have a comic called <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/playlist/169023/hay">hay</a>, but I'd rather not consider it for a single second), EXTREMELY rarely animate, and I like doing photography.</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have also realised that I have been writing like a dullard for basically this whole website! Sometimes I like to use excamation marks too! Although to be fair I am rather monotone in my way of speaking. And it's not like I'm going to be able to show what my actual personality is like while writing a text file like I am talking to other people. Oh well!

                    <p>
                        Before I finish with this site, I'll add a few more things. A short about me, and I wanna try making one of those fancy follow buttons that I've seen around.

                <div class="box">
                    <p>
                        Perhaps I went a bit overboard. The text is too hard to read. Oh well. I'm going on holiday tomorrow, so after that I'll probably restart this site and try again. On the bright side, I think making this devlog here helped with what I want to do with this site in the future - instead of large blogs like I'll have on my site, I can share some small thoughts I have instead! Could be cool.

                    <p>
                        Couldn't think of a solution for the scrolling background (i could make a gif but the gif maker I found has a watermark) so I settled for a static tiled image for now. Also trying text with outlines and stuff and hover.

                <div class="box">
                    <p>
                        Having trouble thinking about the solution to this specific aforementioned problem. I could just change the background on hover, but I want a scrolling background specifically. hmm. Maybe I'll change the font instead. I don't wanna do comic sans again, I've done that on all / most of my past sites, so let's do something different.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>
                        Okay so my original plan for getting the previously mentioned idea to work was to have a white background and have the boxes also have white backgrounds, then have the opacity go to zero on hover to reveal a new background behind it, but I now cannot do that because the white background is also behind it and that will block it.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>
                        Had an idea for the site! I was thinking about liking the basic HTML look but also wanted something different and I also wanted to do more when the colour on hover changes (e.g. make the text white to have it be better read against the background) and I thought about having a window to a basically entirely new site on hover, with a scrolling background and stuff. Wanna see if I can do that.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>
                        Realised I could make it so the paragraph tag has a max width of 50vw instead of needing to put a secondary div inside all those boxes.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>
                        I like when you hover on things it changes. For some reason the idea to make them widen on hover popped into my head, but I didn't want to do that because then the text in the box would change position when you hovered over it and I couldn't be bothered to go with the simple fix that would solve it (putting a second div inside the box div) so I made the background colour blue on hover instead. I really liked this so I went ahead and did the widening thing anyway. Pretty cool. Then I was having fun so unfortunately I will play around with this website more.
