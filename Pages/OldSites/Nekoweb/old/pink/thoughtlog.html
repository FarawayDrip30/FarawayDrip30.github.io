                    <p>[16:17 25/08/2024] Made a random website greeting so I don't do that little corner of the web thing. Also moved the text wobbling script to a different file so it's not in index.html which did a bit of fucking everything up past funtionality for a bit, but now it's fine!</p>
                    <p>[13:50 23/08/2024] It seems like everybody on this website likes to claim that this is their little corner of the web. Perhaps a random word generator is needed for a kick to the variety system.</p>
                    <p>[15:51 21/08/2024] "I wanna be the guy" is such a cool name for something. It really is a shame that if I play another difficult precision platformer I will go insane!</p>
                    <p>[13:55 21/08/2024] I think <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Motherfucking Website</a> has made me less creative website-wise. Sure, having a website be accessible and simple is cool and all but I want to do in-your face dumb unnecessary javascript programming stuff. It seems this may be a common sentiment 'cos while I was searching for the link I found <a href="https://dyf-tfh.github.io/">this site</a> (which still doesn't agree entirely but whatever) so I'm gonna add lots of unnecessary stupid javascript stuff to this page. Because that's awesome too.</p>
                    <p>[13:46 21/08/2024] Royal Blue is my favourite colour but yellow is increasingly closing in while being my second, so I want to make this site yellowy. Yellow gives me a shock to the brain that's pretty fun, it's why I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_Up_(album)">Coming Up by Suede</a>'s album cover, I think.</p>
                    <p>[13:38 21/08/2024] I Finished a <a href="https://farawaydrip30.itch.io/seascale-mapper-001">game jam</a> yesterday but went to a fake wedding afterwards so I couldn't get the karma at the beginning for the beginning flood of ratings to come in but that's okay, because I would rather go to a fake wedding with my friends than sit inside playing videogames for several hours straight.</li>
                    <p>[13:38 21/08/2024] We're back.</li>
