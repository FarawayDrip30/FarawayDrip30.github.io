    <p>My friend <a href="https://raflines.github.io/">flines</a> made a discord bot called "Snowball" and it had it's own world containing a quirky cast of characters. I decided I wanted to make a cartoon based on it. I was planning to make it a series at the time because I was a stupid child but this was the only one I made. I also made the theme music.</p>
