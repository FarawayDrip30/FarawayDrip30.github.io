    <p>The first animation I made in Krita and the first I published, on Newgrounds. I wanted to make a song for it specifically with lyrics like "Bopping his head to the radio, the radio, the radio" but I could not make music and I could not sing so that was down the pan.</p>
    <p>The song is <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1003048">Cody Travers</a> by <a href="https://audiolion.newgrounds.com/">AudioLion</a></p>
