    <h1>Websites</h1>
    <p>I thought it would be appropriate for the first blog for the new website being one about websites. I don't know why, but websites are just cool. It's neat a have a full, explorable graphics-design area that talks about and is themed about a specific topic, which for me is mainly bands and stuff (a really good example of this is <a target="_parent" href="http://www.oliviatremorcontrol.com/">The Oliva Tremor Control website</a>, although maybe just cos it has a lot of pages to look through and is a bit strange) for whatever reason. </p> 
    <p>There's not much that serves the same niche that a website does in this, except for maybe magazines (which have their own pros over websites, of course), with websites also having the bonus of interactions - a space dedicated (mostly) purely to something, and that's just viewing websites as a space. There's also chat rooms and forums and buying things and all kinds of interactive stuff that's cool. You know what a website is I don't really know why I'm explaining it to you here.</p>
    <p>There's been some talk about the decline of the personal website recently. I think since every social media has started vying for your time (more than before), people have been looking back into the past for simpler ways of staying connected online without all the death spiral stuff, leading to personal website revival sites like <a target="_parent" href="https://nekoweb.org/">Nekoweb</a> and <a target="_parent" href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>. Their existence can only be a good thing, and I like how discoverable all the websites are as opposed to other server hosts like <a target="_parent" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github.io</a> (which is what I use) but it is strange to me how both the predominant versions of this are both cat-themed, and also have quite a number of furries using them, which I have no quarrel with but would like a way to browse the net without a big rotund blue fox starting at me every other page.</p>
    <p>As for personal websites coming back, I don't really see it happening unless it becomes some kind of short-lasting trend for most people. I know most people online used personal websites in their heyday but I fear that was actually because the people online were the ones that were interested in technology more, whereas now everyone has it to chat with friends and watch videos and whatnot - using regular social media is just far more convenient and has built-in chatting and other interaction features, and just that everybody else you know is on it. Personal websites are just for those interested in the field now, which is fine.</p>
    <p>A part of personal websites that should definitely come back is theming, however. On most social media the only things you can change on your profile is the test, banner and profile picture, which kinda sucks. More customisation is needed, and I know this cos I use <a target="_parent" href="https://ambassadors.airbuds.fm/join-beta">airbuds</a>, an app that shares what music you're listening to with your friends. They have a "space" feature that lets you customise a "page" (you see where I'm going with this?) with artists and songs and albums and images and text and stuff and people seem to enjoy using it. It's still more restrictive than a website but it shows that people have fun with this kind of thing still. Social media is so barren you could lose a small white dog in it.</p>
    <p>Anyway yeah websites are cool consider making one.</p>
