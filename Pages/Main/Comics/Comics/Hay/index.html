    <h1>Hay</h1>
    <img src="BookFront.png">
    <p>Hay was the first digital comic series I made. It came from me being a child and watching the Jonochrome developer commentaries about One Night at Flumpty's, where the characters (mainly a god egg guy) were from a comic he made with his friends. I wanted to make a comic like that so I stole the idea of a god character and made this. I made all the comics in MS Paint because Jonochrome also did that, but also because I could make them easily. This worked, if I ever had an idea or was suggested an idea I could make it in no time, for better or for worse but I think most of these jokes fucking suck. I think Hay has ended now, but if I ever get a funny idea for a comic I might add a new one? I don't know. I think Hay's dead in the dirt.</p>

    <p>This was the first one. I literally stole the whole joke from the Flumpty's comic, except in that one it was about wearing boots instead of having a head made of cheese. I hate this one.</p>

    <p>Props to me, this was an original joke, and also features the bird character that I would basically replace the cheese head guy from the first comic for the rest of the series cos I liked his design more. I still do. Unfortunately there isn't an actual joke here but it's one of the better comics, still.</p>

    <p>I think this is my favourite one cos it's a joke I actually made myself. I like how I drew the box guy in this one.</p>

    <p>BONUS COMIC!!! This is what the third Hay comic was going to be but, if I recall, I wanted to make a funnier joke so I made the Hay 3 you see above this one. I liked the sausage guy, I don't remember him at all. I also dropped the colouring. I don't remember what the joke was supposed to be here so it looks a bit psychopathic but hey ho. Perhaps in its unfinished state this is the best Hay comic yet?</p>

    <p>This one came from me talking with <a target="_parent" href="https://raflines.github.io/">flines</a> again, we were just talking about stupid ideas for Hey. This is my least favourite one because it's SO RANDOM XD!!!! humor.</p>

    <p>This is my second favourite one because I came up with the joke myself again, I still prefer 3 more because I like the characters more.</p>

    <p>The guy in this one is the cheese head guy again, just so you know. We were talking about Hay and my bud <a target="_parent" href="https://craity.itch.io/">Craity</a> suggested a comic about ingesting plutonium so I made this, I suppose this is a fitting end to the series because he dies. Not for real though. He's a god, remember?</p>
