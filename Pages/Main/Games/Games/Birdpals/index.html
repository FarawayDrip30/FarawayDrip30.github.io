    <p>Birdpals was a club penguin-esque game that me and some friends were making for quite some time, but unforunately when the colour party was launched, whenever one specific guy joined the game, the server crashed, and I couldn't fix it and so gave up. This is a singleplayer port of the game. The project lead guy is currently making it into another project called "Mythkins", but I'm not working on that.</a></p>

        <br>Yeah, lots of people, unfortunately most people either weren't given tasks to do or the stuff they did didn't make it into the game because management was BAD and people kept getting added to the team for no real reason.             oh well.</p>
